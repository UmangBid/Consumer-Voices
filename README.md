# Consumer-Voices
This project leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify consumer complaints data. The primary goal is to provide actionable insights into customer sentiment and categorize complaints to enhance customer experience and streamline complaint resolution processes.

Key Features:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, removing noise, and preparing text data for analysis.
2. Sentiment Analysis: Assessing the emotional tone of complaints using sentiment scores ranging from strongly negative to strongly positive.
3. Text Classification Models: Implementing various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and advanced models like BERT and LightGBM, to categorize complaints into predefined product/service categories.
4. Model Comparison: Evaluating models based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, training time, and prediction time to identify the most efficient and accurate model.
5. Visualization: Using boxplots and other visual tools to showcase insights, such as sentiment distribution across product categories and model performance.

Applications:
Streamlining complaint resolution by routing complaints to the correct department.
Identifying areas of high customer dissatisfaction to prioritize improvements.
Supporting business decisions through data-driven insights into consumer sentiment and feedback.

This project demonstrates the power of NLP and machine learning to solve real-world problems, with potential applications in customer service, business analytics, and beyond.
